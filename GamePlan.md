# Gameplay

## General sense

We want a 2D, isometric style game. You're gonna be able to fight enemies and place things, mostly buildings, into the world. A futureistic setting where the technology is borderline magical.\
Player will start in a building that will be considered homebase, and from there they will have other areas outside of this to explore.\
NPC's won't just pop up into the world, they will be "earned". This can be by having a certain standing, building a certain structure or having a process going, unlocking certain things in the research tree. Dynamic system with a bit of luck involved.\
There isn't any solid "ending" to the game. The motivation is to constantly improve and expand.

### Visual/Art style inspo

The world won't be populated with lots of human entities, so as to invoke a feeling of lonliness. The environment won't be post apocalyptic in the sense of buildings missing large chunks, but more abanonded and dilapidated. The last of us level decay.\
The game won't be as detailed as factorio, but closer to Miska's Cave or IdleOn.

### Building mechanic inspo

The grid system from factorio is a good start for building. However, the building being place in your inventory and then placed down is not something we want. More like the forest where you have to bring the resources over to a ghost version of the building.\
When building something you bring resources to the building, which will show visually in a pile, and when all of the resources are there then you can hold an interact key to build which will only take a short while.

### Combat mechanic inspo

Melee weapons degrade, but don't totally break like in Minecraft. Have a repair system.\
There will be melee and ranged weapons.

### Quest mechanic inspo

Quests themselves are similar to Tarkov quests.

## What can be done?

Bolded are things that we wan't to implement first.
**Combat**.\
**Building**. Base planning. Open-world building vs. planned building. Somethings need to be built inside of structures, but not everything does so in the beginning they are artifically restricted to building in their start building.\
Exploration/Expedition. High risk/High reward. Dungeon system.\
NPC/Quest system. Quest book system. Direct quest giving system. Trading with NPC's, and items that are purely for barter.\
**Research tree**/knowledge expansion. Find pieces of technology in the world that unlock branches of the tree based off of knowledge synthesis.\
Resource management and allocation. Maybe allocate NPC's to do work? NPC's do work for some loss but you get automation and improved standing.\
Skills. Basic skills (combat, building, etc.)

## Story

The cities you are surrounded by were once great cities, but something happened to the inhabitants and they disappeared without a trace. These cities didn't get abandonded overnight, but when they left they didn't leave any reasons for why. There are other people in the area as you, but not all are willing to work with you.
